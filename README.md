## Introduction
### This project involves transforming the Dead Rising Remastered trailer from a comedic and action tone to a horror theme. The edits were done using Audacity, following the Interaction Systems course guidelines.
## Process Description
### 1. Original Audio Extraction
#### The original audio was extracted to isolate and modify specific sound elements.

### 2. Creating a Horror Atmosphere
### Sound Effects: 
#### Added typing, helicopter, hospital machine beep, camera click, and various zombie sounds to create a tense and eerie atmosphere.
#### Modified voices, including a worried and angry male voice, villain’s laugh, and a creepy clown laugh, to enhance the horror theme.
#### Incorporated references to other media, like a distorted “Welcome” from Resident Evil 4 and a modified “Get out of my swamp” from Shrek to add depth to the audio.
#### Gunshots and explosions were included to balance action and horror elements.
### Music and Rhythm Adjustments:

#### Removed the original percussion as it disrupted the flow. Added a new instrumental track with adjusted frequency and tempo to fit the horror theme.
#### Background zombie sounds were slowed down and deepened to create an unsettling atmosphere.
### 3. Voiceover and Audio Balancing
#### Radio Effect: A custom voiceover was recorded and modified to sound like a static-filled radio transmission, providing context and setting up the horror scenario.
#### Sound Balancing: All audio tracks were balanced to avoid any element overshadowing others. Effects were applied gradually to ensure smooth transitions.
### 4. Merging Audio and Video
#### The original trailer’s audio was replaced with the new horror-themed track. The video remained unchanged.

### 5. Final Export
#### The edited trailer was exported, maintaining the original duration but with a completely transformed audio experience.
