#Dead Rising Remastered Trailer Transformation
##Introduction
###This project focuses on transforming the trailer for Dead Rising Remastered from a comedic and action-oriented tone to a horror-themed experience. The trailer was edited using the audio editing software Audacity in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Interaction Systems course.

##Process Description
###1. Original Audio Extraction
The original audio from the Dead Rising Remastered trailer was extracted using audio extraction tools. This allowed for the isolation and manipulation of the sound elements to create a different atmosphere.

###2. Creating a Horror Atmosphere
####Instrumental Track: A full instrumental track was added to build a more ominous atmosphere. This track's frequency and timing were adjusted to blend seamlessly with the rest of the audio.
####Percussion and Rhythms: Additional percussion and rhythm tracks were incorporated to generate tension and maintain an unsettling tone throughout the trailer.
####Zombie Scream: A modified zombie scream was introduced at the start of the trailer, where the logos appear, to set a chilling tone from the beginning. The frequency of this scream was altered to make it sound more terrifying.
####Preservation of Sound Effects and Dialogues: Select fragments of the original audio were preserved to retain key sound effects and dialogues, ensuring the trailer remained narratively coherent.
####Volume Adjustments: The volumes of all tracks were carefully balanced to ensure that no element overpowered the others at inappropriate moments.
###3. Merging Audio and Video
####Using video editing software, the original trailer audio was replaced with the newly edited audio. The video itself remained unaltered to comply with project restrictions.

###4. Final Export
####The edited trailer was exported in video format, ensuring that the final product maintained the original trailer's duration while fully transforming the audio to reflect the desired horror theme.
